Building
========

To build this on Windows, you'll need MinGW, GCC, SDL and SDL_ttf, and the Scons
build system. Simply navigate to the project with cmd or PowerShell and type
"scons". Yeah, it's a crazy workflow. I'm a Linux guy, and I haven't bothered to
learn the right way to do things in Windows yet.

It should build with no problem at all on *nix (including OSX) as long as you
have the above, minus MinGW, with a couple of minor edits to the
Sconstruct. Godspeed! 

Oh yeah, it doesn't actually do anything yet
